**[click on an image to watch trailer.]**

**TOGETHER OUT** is refined version of [**The Adventure of Khao Neeo Mamuang**](https://github.com/Jirajate/The-Adventure-of-Khao-Neeo-Mamuang) which is a couch co-op action-adventure game with the side-scrolling perspective. The setting is the retro city around the world which created in the virtual world. The players will play as May and June, the girls who were tied together by a strange string and sent to this world. What actually happens to them?, the players must figure out themselves in this awaiting adventure.
May and June were told that this virtual world is a part of the Global Management Program for Children (GMPC) program. This program has the objective to help children from a drought issue. By biological technology, the program can let children grow up in the glass tubes and send their consciousness to the virtual world, in order to give them a good environment and health care at the same time. However, everything in the virtual world is clearly contradicted to this information. There must be something May and June have not known about this world yet.
